                       Welcome to my website! Here you will find my paper hosted for your perusal. 
                   I'll be going over Lord of the Rings and how it's story has influenced the work of Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of genre defining games such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and most recently, Elden Ring. 
                   For this paper, there are some terms you need to know. A soulsborne game refers to specifically Demon Souls, the Dark Souls trilogy, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring. A soulslike, however, refers to any other action RPG that has similar difficulty and gameplay mechanics to a soulsborne game.
                   Lastly, a metroidvania refers to a semi-linear 2D platformer that places emphasis on deep exploration and stylistic atmosphere.
                   With that out of the way, sit back, relax, grab a snack, and enjoy the presentation!
