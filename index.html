                       Welcome to my website! Here you will find my paper hosted for your perusal. 
                   I'll be going over Lord of the Rings and how it's story has influenced the work of Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of genre defining games such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and most recently, Elden Ring. 
                   For this paper, there are some terms you need to know. A soulsborne game refers to specifically Demon Souls, the Dark Souls trilogy, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring. A soulslike, however, refers to any other action RPG that has similar difficulty and gameplay mechanics to a soulsborne game.
                   A metroidvania refers to a semi-linear 2D platformer that places emphasis on deep exploration and stylistic atmosphere.
                   The Tarnished is the main protagonist of Elden Ring, The Hunter is the main protagonist of Bloodborne, the Chosen Undead is the main protagonist of Dark Souls 1, the Bearer of the Curse for Dark Souls 2, and the Unkindled for Dark Souls 3.

                      There is also some background knowlege you need for Elden Ring(it's really confusing).
                   An Outer God is a very powerful being that influences the beliefs of the citizens of The Lands Between. The Lands Between is the setting of Elden Ring. A demigod is the child of the royalty of The Lands Between. 
                   An empyerean is a demi god that has the potential to reach godhood. The Elden Ring is a set of runes created by the Greater Will, an outer god. The Elden Ring represents the laws that govern reality in The Lands Between.
                   The Erdtree is a physical representation of the Elden Ring and the Golden Order, ruled by Queen Marika and Radagon, the Elden Lord at the time of the game's events. Finally, Grace is a golden light that is connected to the Erdtree and the Golden Order.
                   With that out of the way, sit back, relax, grab a snack, and enjoy the presentation!
