                    When considering classic literature, many scholars have a narrow view of what genres are allowed such a prestigious title. Fantasy fiction, for example, was considered too childish to be classic literature. 
                    This left timeless series like <i>Lord of The Rings</i> (<i>LotR</i>) to be relegated to simple children’s garbage. Modern day definitions of classic literature are more lenient and have allowed <i>LotR</i> to be considered classic literature. Classical literature now is defined as “timeless books from any time period, including classical works.” <sup>1</sup> 
                    Now that <i>LotR</i> has been given this status, it begs the question of how its influence has been felt in modern literature, a question asked and thoroughly answered of many other pieces of classic literature. One way it has laid groundwork is for many modern-day fantasy video games. 
                    As a rising medium, there is not much precedent to go off because many people don’t realize the deep connections between video games and more traditional storytelling. Despite this, many people have noticed the D.N.A of <i>LotR</i> in several games.

                    Quite possibly the most influential games people have noticed this in are the soulsborne games by FromSoftware that have quickly become household names. Initially made by Hidetaka Miyazaki, games such as Demon Souls, the <i>Dark Souls</i> trilogy, <i>Bloodborne</i>, and <i>Elden Ring</i> have each been breakout successes and have received critical acclaim. 
                    Soulsborne games use increased difficulty and using death as a learning opportunity to appeal to players who desire more of a challenge when playing games.<sup>2</sup> People have quickly noticed the way that LotR has paved the way for several aspects of the soulsborne games and the soulslike genre as a whole. 
                    From certain gameplay elements like combat encounters and puzzle solving to story elements like worldbuilding and the vastness of the lore outside of the main story, there is no shortage of similarities.
