                    The story of LotR closely follows the hero’s journey as described by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 book <i>The Hero of a Thousand Faces</i>. This “monomyth”, as he calls it, follows a set path and is seen in much of classic literature from Beowulf to Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland. 
                    According to Campbell, the monomyth follows three main stages: Departure, Initiation, and Return. 
                    Each stage can be broken into smaller stages, totaling 17 stages <sup>3</sup>. In the case of <i>LotR</i>, it follows all of the monomyth to some degree. Listing only the most important parts: Frodo gets his call to adventure from Gandalf, initially refusing it. 
                    Gandalf could also be considered Frodo’s supernatural aid, guiding him through his journey. Leaving the Shire would be the crossing of the threshold, and the meeting with Galadriel could be seen as a meeting with a goddess. 
                    The destruction of the One Ring would be the ultimate boon, and the eagles that rescue Sam and Frodo from Mount Doom would be the rescue from without.

                   The conformation of LotR to the framework of the monomyth has been a subject of study for many years. What hasn’t been, is the the way that the Soulsborne games follow this framework. 
                    Since all of them follow similar story structures, the most recent one: <i>Elden Ring</i>, will be focused on. In <i>Elden Ring</i>, you play as one of the Tarnished. The Tarnished are essentially undead and immortal beings who go on a quest to retrieve the Elden Ring, and are guided by the Grace, a golden light representative of the the Elden Ring and Erdtree<sup>4</sup>. 
                    The call to adventure, according to Campbell, is classified by the following circumstances: “Typical of the circumstances of the call are the dark forest, the great tree, the babbling spring, and the loathly, underestimated appearance of the carrier of the power of destiny.”<sup>5</sup> In this case, we would consider the appearance of the Tarnished as the latter. 
                    In game during the opening cutscene, they are described as “Whom grace would again bless. A Tarnished of no renown. Cross the fog, to the Lands Between. To stand before the Elden Ring. And become the Elden Lord.”<sup>6</sup>

                  The Tarnished, after appearing in The Lands Between, is then immediately killed by a boss enemy and revived. This is a common trope that appears in all Soulsborne games as a teaching mechanism to show the danger of bosses. This then launches the tutorial of the game, after which the player is presented with a door. 
                    This is a quite literal crossing of the threshold where the player opens the door and is presented with the open world of The Lands Between. In the game, the player can rest at Sites of Grace, which serve as checkpoints that recover health and MP (which is the resource for casting spells). 
                    After resting at three Sites of Grace, the player meets Melina, a spirit who serves as deuteragonist and Finger Maiden to the Tarnished. Finger Maidens are responsible for sharing the guidance of the Two Fingers, a vassal of the Greater Will. This could be considered the supernatural aid or the meeting of the goddess. 
                    Since <i>Elden Ring</i> is an open world game that is not linear and has multiple endings, there is no one set path of trials. However, there are certain bosses that are story requirements to obtain runes from the Elden Ring.

                  The ultimate boon is difficult to talk about. Here lies the distinction between video games and books: in video games, the player, as well as the player character, is a character in the story. 
                    The player character serves as a persona for the player to experience the story as they want to experience it. This means that the ultimate boon is different for the player and the player character. For the player, the ultimate boon would be completing an ending of the game. 
                    This is different than the ultimate boon of the player character, which in the cannon of the game would be becoming the Elden Lord. By interacting with the story, you directly change the outcome of the story by interacting with it, therefore you become a character. 
                    According to Campbell, the hallmark of the ultimate boon is “The ease with which the adventure is here accomplished signifies that the hero is a superior man, a born king<sup>7</sup>.” In this case, the player character literally becomes a king in the Elden Lord. 
                    The player, throughout the leveling of their character and obtaining new items and abilities, becomes a superior man, able to do more and powerful enough to easily fight all the major threats of the game. 
                    The player and player character intrinsically tied together in a form of immersive theater, and while many may feel the connection to Frodo in <i>LotR</i>, the reader realizes that they are still an outside observer looking into a story.
