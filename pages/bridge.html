                    LotR had influences on different forms of media way before modern day video games. <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, more commonly shorted to <i>DND</i>, is a tabletop roleplaying game released in 1974 and created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson<sup>9</sup>. 
                  The game features players creating characters on paper with various stat distributions and classes going on high fantasy adventures with gameplay mechanics like rolling various dice to determine outcomes, solving puzzles, and fighting enemies. 
                  There are obvious mechanics at play here that have since translated into video games, like the Hit Point system, often shortened to HP, the aspect of random chance, and the creation of custom characters for human players to interact with a story through. 
                  These ideas have been used in almost every video game since their inception but have an increased importance in role playing games (RPGs). 
                  <i>DND</i> reportedly has many of its roots in war style board games such as <i>Chainmail</i>, Gygax’s own wargame<sup>10</sup>. There are also clear inspirations from various works of literature, such as the works of H.P. Lovecraft, ancient mythology, and <i>LotR</i>.

                     The groundwork laid by <i>DND</i> has even come full circle to create <i>LotR</i> video games. One such game is <i>Lord of the Rings Online</i>. A Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) released in 2007 and still being maintained to this day. 
                  The game takes place during the War of the Ring as you are placed in the shoes of an unassuming adventurer trying to live during that time. The game uses loot systems, hit points, leveling, class systems, and more that are clearly derived from <i>DND</i>. 
                  The game also features many locations from the LotR series, such as The Shire, Rivendell, Lothlorien, and more<sup>11</sup>. The systems mentioned are only just the surface of the game, and it is so sprawling that you could play for years and still not experience everything. 
                  Compared to the Soulsborne games, MMOs are called massive for a reason. However, there is still plenty to do in a game like <i>Bloodborne</i>, a game so influential that it is part of the namesake of Soulsborne. 
                  The game takes immense inspiration from the works of H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe in the dark gothic setting of Yharnam. The game has multiple endings, like <i>Elden Ring</i>, but the gameplay is generally considered more intense and story driven. 
                  Gameplay mechanics directly correlate with the ending you get. 
                  For example, to get the true ending of the game, you must find three umbilical cords. Each one grants a permanent stat boost but also gives access to the true final boss. There are also gameplay mechanics that alter different areas of the game. 
                  If you gain enough insight, you’ll begin to see creatures that weren’t previously visible, representative of your character getting closer to the truth of the world.

                   You are also able to turn your player character into one of the enemy beasts by equipping a certain rune, and increasing your Beasthood meter (which represents your max physical damage multiplier when using certain consumables), represents your decent towards this monstrous appearance, though only the rune changes your character’s appearance. 
                  Video games, especially RPGs, tend to turn certain aspects of stories into silent mechanics that add to immersion, which plays into the adage of “show don’t tell” that most video games and movies live by.
