                    Worldbuilding is a huge part of “show, don’t tell”. J.R.R. Tolkien knew the power of worldbuilding and leveraged it to create a world that endures seventy-one years after its inception. 
                    Through creating a compelling base world by carefully crafting mythos, language, and diverse terrains through vivid imagery. Video games do this in much the same way, only through a visual medium, which provides many differences. Firstly, the visuals of video games are much more visceral. 
                    Take the tall, imposing architecture of Dark Souls. It’s become an iconic part of the Dark Souls brand just like places like The Shire and Mordor are for LotR. The ancient buildings in both LotR and Dark Souls both show the rich history of the worlds they are set in. 
                    The best example of this is  <i>LotR</i>’ Minas Tirith, and <i>Dark Souls</i>’ Anor Londo. Both are respective capitals of their kingdoms (Gondor and Lordran), and both are clearly inspired by European architecture. 
                    Minas Tirith was even called Minas Anor at one point, meaning “Tower of the Sun” in Elvish, while Anor Londo means “City of the Sun”<sup>12</sup>.

                    Outside of <i>Dark</i> Souls directly using Tolkien’s Elvish language and similar architectural styles, it also follows a similar story structure (the monomyth). 
                    The player character must either link with or extinguish the First Flame, responsible for maintaining and separating aspects of the world such as light and dark, gods and mortals, and life and death<sup>13</sup>. 
                    The existence of these ancient buildings suggests the cyclical nature of both worlds. In the world of LotR, good is constantly clashing with evil, while in Dark Souls the First Flame is constantly going out and needs to be rekindled. 
                    Failure to do these tasks results in evil overtaking the world. In <i>Dark Souls 3</i>, you play as the Unkindled, a warrior who failed to light the First Flame in the past. 
                    The story involves the player returning the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones so they can link the First Flame and prevent the kingdom of Lothric from being plunged into darkness. 
                    One thing to note is that the places you visit in Lothric are distorted places from Lordran, implying that <i>Dark Souls 1</i> and <i>Dark Souls 3</i> are linked in a cycle of linking the First Flame. 
                    The “good” ending of the game involved extinguishing the First Flame and ushering the Age of Dark, with the promise that an Age of Fire will come again and not be prolonged this time<sup>14</sup>. The themes of cycles of light and dark directly oppose LotR’ message of defeating evil and darkness.

                    Soulsborne games like to hide their wider stories in journal entries, item descriptions, and optional puzzles. Tolkien also does this with <i>LotR</i>, but does it through having a wealth of extra media outside of the main trilogy for fans to comb through. 
                    In both cases, fans of the series are rewarded for their dedication outside of the main gameplay or story by understanding the world in greater depth. 
                    Interestingly, the knowledge of the extra media is used as a gatekeeping tool for diehard fans of the series; only true fans know about the secret media. 
                    The existence of the hunt for lore has strengthened the bond between fans of the series but has alienated potential fans for fear of ridicule.
