    <h1>Turning a Problem into a Promise</h1>
    <p>It is our job as businesses to solve problems. That and to generate money. However, if we are solving a problem, we want people to know we are solving <em>their</em> problem. The best way to do that online? Headers. 
The h1 tag is the giant neon sign saying "We can help you!" After that, it's the job of the paragraph to turn the <i>problem</i> into a <em>promise</em>. </p>
    <p>The p tag is a <b>powerful</b> tool in relaying additional information to consumers. It allows explaination. What is a <i>promise</i> if there is no evidence to back up the claim? People will disregard it and you will be left with no one.
    The paragraph creates and <strong>explains</strong> your promise. </p>
