                    The creation of Soulsborne as a genre lends credence to the impact of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s work on the <i>Dark Souls</i> series, <i>Bloodborne</i>, and <i>Elden Ring</i>. They are staples of the role-playing game genre, just as J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> series has been a staple of the fantasy fiction genre. 
                  The Soulsborne games have felt the impact of the story framework laid down by <i>LotR</i>, and because the Soulsborne games have been so influential themselves, it’s lead to a trickle-down effect where all modern-day RPGs have been influenced by <i>LotR</i>. 
                  Both series have stories rooted in the monomyth, or hero’s journey, as identified by Joseph Campbell in <i>The Hero of a Thousand Faces</i>. 
                  Aspects that normally are explained in a story are instead left to the player and turned into gameplay, leaving the ultimate ending up to the player while the player character experiences a specific ending in the cannon of the games.

                    Lord of the Rings also has had its influence on Dungeons and Dragons, which created many elements that games use today, such as HP and random chance. 
                  LotR has even spawned its own video games, such as the popular MMORPG Lord of the Rings Online, using the same mechanics that LotR helped create. Of course, as RPGs, the Soulsborne games use these mechanics as well, and use certain unique gameplay mechanics to help tell their stories. 
                  Things such as the eldritch knowledge the Hunter of <i>Bloodborne</i> gains when gaining enough points in their Insight stat or collecting umbilical cords to unlock the true final boss.

                    Soulsborne games also tell their stories through worldbuilding. The ancient architecture and use of Elvish in the <i>Dark Souls</i> series take obvious inspiration from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, as well as the history of both games in a cyclical nature of fighting darkness and evil. 
                  While <i> Lord of the Rings</i>’ conclusion to this conflict is to let light triumph always,<i> Dark Souls</i> views darkness as necessary so that light can shine even brighter when it returns. 
                  While the Soulsborne games are dark fantasy, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is a story of light. However, the light of both worlds will always shine in the end as they continue to influence modern fantasy in subtle ways that will always be felt, even if they are never seen.
