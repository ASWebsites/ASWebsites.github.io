    <h1>Your Website Should Look as Professional as You Are</h1>
    <h2>Custom Designs That Make Small Businesses Feel Big</h2>
    <p>
      Most small business websites <strong>blend into the background</strong>—generic templates, clunky layouts, and zero personality. 
      That’s not just a design flaw—it’s a credibility killer. 
      <strong>Your brand deserves better.</strong> When your site looks outdated or uninspired, potential customers click away before they even know what you offer. 
      I craft websites that <strong>feel premium, look unique, and build trust instantly</strong>—so your business stands out and stays memorable.
